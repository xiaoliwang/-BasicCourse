## Adjectives and Adverbs
> Adjectives such as *beautiful*, *nice* and *red* describe **nouns**.   
> Adverbs such as *quickly*, *badly* or *warmly* describe **verbs**.

Adverbs are usually made from adjectives by adding **-LY**

Adjective ending in ... | How to make the adverb | Examples
---- | ---- | ----
y | Change Y to I and add -LY | heavy - heavily <br /> happy - happily <br /> lazy - lazily
\[anything\] else | Just add -LY | warm - warmly <br /> nice - nicely <br /> loud - loudly

There are some important exceptions:
Adjective | Adverb
---- | ----
good | well
late | late[^late]
early | early
fast | fast
hard | hard[^hard]

> some verbs(such as look, sound, smell and taste) are followed by adjectives to describe the subject of the sentence.

## Comparatives and Superlatives of Adjectives
> Comparatives and Superlatives are special forms of adjectives. They are used to compare two or more things. 

Generally, comparatives are formed using **-er** and superlatives are formed using **-est**. How these forms are created depends on how many syllables[^syllables] these are in the adjective. 

Adjective form | Comparative | superlative
---- | ---- | ----
Only one syllable, ending in E. <br /> Example:*wide*, *fine*, *cute*| Add -R: <br /> *wider*, *finer*, *cuter* | Add -ST: <br /> *widest*, *finest*, *cutest*
Only one syllable, with one vowel and one consonant at the end. <br /> Example: *hot*, *big*, *fat* | Double the consonant, and add -ER: <br /> *hotter*, *bigger*, *fatter* | Double the consonant, and add -EST: <br /> *hottest*, *biggest*, *fattest*
Only one syllable with more than one vowel or more than one consonant at the end. <br /> Examples: *light*, *neat*, *fast* | Add -ER: <br /> *lighter*, *neater*, *faster* | Add -EST: <br /> *lightest*, *neatest*, *fastest*
Two syllables, ending in Y. <br /> Example: *happy*, *silly*, *lonely* | Change Y to I, then add -ER: <br /> *happier*, *sillier*, *lonelier* | Change Y to I, then add -EST: <br /> *happiest*, *silliest*, *loneliset*
Two syllables or more, not ending in Y. <br /> Examples: *modern*, *interesting*, *beautiful* | Use **More** before the adjective: <br /> *more mordern*, *more interesting*, *more beautiful* | Use **Most** before the adjective: <br />
*most mordern*, *most interesting*, *most beautiful*

[^late]: *lately* means recently. It is not the adverb from *late*.
[^hard]: *hardly* means not much. It is not the adverb from *hard*.
[^syllables]: *Syllables* are like "sound beats", For instance, "sing" contains one syllable, but "singing" contains two \-\- *sing* and *ing*
