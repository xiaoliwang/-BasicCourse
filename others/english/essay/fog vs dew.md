### fog vs dew (draft)

Fog computing and dew computing are two new computing paradigms which are similar to cloud computing. Both of them contain not only servers but also clients. But with different goals, they go through different paths.

The proposed of fog computing is connecting all things(clients),[1] usually we call it IoT(Internet of Things). The key idea of IoT is that clients are connected to servers directly without human intervention. For this purpose, clients must be automation [2]devices such as sensors. An interesting example of fog computing is weather monitoring. The sensors send billion of weather data to cloud server in one day automatically.[3]

Besides, dew computing is an Internet concept. With respect to IoT, the clients must be computers with people operations.[4] The goal is people can do some work without connecting to servers. [5] For example, it makes visiting a web page without internet possible.

In conclusion, the main difference between them are whether the clients are computers of sensors and whether human participation.[6]


### Suggestions

[1] The purpose of fog computing is to connect

[2] automatic or automatable (automation is a noun)

[3]billions, servers. Billions of data is an unusual construction. Huge or large or gigantic or some such adjective is used with data as in huge amounts of data. But billions of measurements or observations is usual.

[4] human operators 

[5] The goal is for people to be able to work without ...

[6] differences...are, computers or sensors and whether there is human ....
