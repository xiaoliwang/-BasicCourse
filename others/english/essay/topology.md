Topology

Topology is an important field of study out of geometry and set theory in mathematics. The most two important topological properties are connectedness and compactness. Connectedness means the space is connected and compactness means the space is closed and bounded.

You see, the mathematical concpts are not easy to understand. So, I will tell some interesting examples to describe what the topology is.

Topology is an study about holes and tails. There are two classes called homeomorphism and homotopy in Topology. Homeomorphism cares about both holes and tails while homotopy cares about only holes. One joke about topologist is these guys cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut, because both coffee mug and doughnut have one hole and no tail. Also, A and R are the same from this point. Why don't people pierced? Because that will change people's topological structure.

And an other interesting example of topology is hairy ball theorem. It says that "one cannot comb the hair flat on a hairy ball without creating a cowlick". Imagine you have a hairy ball and you comb all hair horizontally. There are at least two hair at the north and south pole are not flat. This is what the topologists are interested in.

I don't know much about topology. But I hope this essay helpful.
